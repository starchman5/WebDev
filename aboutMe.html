    <h1>Just a kid with a dream</h1>
    <p>I am Travis from Orange County. Rock
       N' Roll is near-religious for me. 
       I'm a guitarist, a luthier, a sporadic 
       bagpiper (seriously) and I like to cook, 
       take drives while listening to music, 
       and play with my crazy dogs. I would 
       like to get a project car or two 
       sometime in the future and begin a 
       restoration. I have been working as 
       a pharmacy technician for several years 
       since graduating from Arizona State University.
       I began my journey here by taking some
       computer science courses at Pasadena City
       College.</p>

    <p>Some of the cars I would choose for my restoration project are (in no particular order):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1969 Chevy Chevelle</li>
        <li>1978 Chevy El Camino</li>
        <li>1957 Chevy Bel Air</li>
        <li>1966 Ford Mustang</li>
        <li>1955 Cadillac DeVille</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My All-Time Top 5 albums would be as follows:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Band</th>
            <th>Album</th>
            <th>Year</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1. The Rolling Stones</td>
            <td>Exile On Main Street</td>
            <td>1972</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2. The Black Crowes</td>
            <td>Shake Your Money Maker</td>
            <td>1990</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3. Oasis</td>
            <td>(What's The Story) Morning Glory?</td>
            <td>1995</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4. Aerosmith</td>
            <td>Toys In The Attic</td>
            <td>1975</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5. Led Zeppelin</td>
            <td>Physical Graffiti</td>
            <td>1975</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>My favorite passion, however, is the guitar. 
       I went to luthiery school in 2007 and I plan 
       on having my own personal shop space someday 
       so that I can play mad scientist. Here are my 
       top 5 favorite guitars along with their corresponding
       photos:</p>

       <ol>
           <li>Noel Gallagher's Union Jack Dot-Style</li>
           <li>Epiphone Flamekat</li>
           <li>Chuck Berry's Wine Red Gibson double-cut</li>
           <li>Billie Joe Armstrong's "Blue" guitar</li>
           <li>Eddie Van Halen's Frankenstein</li>
